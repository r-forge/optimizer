Changes in Rvmmin

Changes before 2012-4-30 not recorded 

TODOS
   o    Saving of final Hessian approx as in Rvmminx

   o    Eventual incorporation of line searches, possibly in a
        separate routine

2017-7-18
   o    Simplify example

   o    Added tests

2016-11-30
   o    Vignette added (incomplete)

2015-11-30
   o    Changed control "stopbadupdate" to TRUE from FALSE.

2015-06-03
   o    Had "lower" instead of "upper" in one of the bounds checks.
        Fixed.

2015-05-03
   o    Check gradient count ig > 2 when doing convergence test.
	Possible failure for test fn = sum(x*x) noted. However, 
	other fns fail with this change. This is an issue in the
	program logic rather than an algorithmic failure. 

2015-01-07

   o    comments in codes Rvmminb.R and Rvmminu.R aligned so that the
        differences between bounds constrained version and unconstrained
        more easily visualized
        
   o    control keepinputpar explained. It is used when user does NOT want
        out-of-bounds parameters on input moved to nearest bound. Program
        will stop in this case.
        
   o    Minor changes to maxit and maxfeval defaults so that they are 
        increased with increasing numbers of parameters.

2014-12-21 

   o    As per CRAN policies, edited DESCRIPTION and NAMESPACE files. 
	Because there is no change to code, the date of the package 
	advanced by only 1 day.

2013-10-27 
   
   o    Added maxfevals to control. (It had been there some time.)

2013-8-19

   o    Numerical gradient from optextras, remove bmchk from package,
	put bmchk call in Rvmmin, not Rvmminb

2013-7-20
   o    Minor improvements to timing by use of crossprod() in 
        computing y and D2

2012-7-9
   o    Removed optansout to avoid conflicts with optplus/optimx

2012-5-21
   o	Separation of constrained and unconstrained versions.
