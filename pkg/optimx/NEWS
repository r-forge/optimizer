Changes in optimx 

Changes before 2012-4-30 not recorded 

TODOS
   o    Axial search needs to be tested and possibly adjusted for 
        dealing with maximization. (This is actually in optfntools,
	but will almost certainly be accessed through package
	optimx.)

   o    Entire code needs to be checked for vestiges of earlier
	changes and diagnostic output, as well as being better
	formatted.

   o	Changed to use new structure opxfn which is an environment
	created with list2env. This environment allows the passing
	of scaling information as well as recording of function,
	gradient and hessian counts. Note that the structure may
	be extended later, and that it also affects package
	optfntools.

   o	Control axsearch.tries = 0 should suppress axial search.
