Package: SQUAREM
Title: Squared extrapolation methods for optimization acceleration FIX
Description: FIX Algorithms for accelerating the convergence of slow, monotone 
 sequences from algorithms such as EM. It can be used to accelerate any linearly
 convergent acceleration scheme.  A tutorial style introduction to this package is available in a 
 vignette on the CRAN download page or, when the package is loaded in an R 
 session, with vignette("SQUAREM").
Depends: R (>= 2.10.0)
