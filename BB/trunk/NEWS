  o added BBsolve wrapper function.  

  o minor documentation fixes found by the new parser in R-devel.


           Changes in BB version 2008.11-1
  
  o "eps" decreased to 1.e-10 (from 1.e-08) in sane, to be consistent 
      with "eps" for dfsane.

  o Nelder-Mead start option for poor starting values in sane and dfsane.

  o Steplength for first iteration was re-scaled in sane and dfsane.

  o Retard scheme is introduced close to solution in sane and dfsane.

  o A new stopping criterion "noimp" is introduced (flag=4 in sane, flag=3 in
    dfsane).

  o "optim" can be invoked using "L-BFGS-B" when "sane" is unsuccessful 
    (type = 4 or 5) by setting BFGS of the control list in the sane arguments.

  o "optim" can be invoked using "L-BFGS-B" when "dfsane" is unsuccessful 
    (type = 2 or 5) by setting BFGS of the control list in the dfsane arguments.
 
  o "pbest" and "normF.best are now returned from sane and dfsane.


           Changes in BB version 2008.8-1
  
  o fixed bug in sane and spg (previously fixed in dfsane) when tol is already 
     ok initially and while loop is skipped, so flag in result is not set. Also
     added a warning message when this happens.

  o fixed bug in dfsane when tol is already ok initially and while loop is

           Changes in BB version 2008.5-1
  
  o fixed a references that was inaccurate and added web links to others.

  o fixed bug when maximizing a function with analytic gradient supplied, and add
    a test of this.
