TODO
      o check on uobyqa and newuoa for controls rhobeg and rhoend.
      o Consider how the hyperbolic transformation (transfinite fn)
        could be used in all unconstrained methods
      o How can transfinite be made to work when start is on bounds?

      o realized control rhobeg needed to be set or bobyqa would fail.

VERSION 2015-12-20
