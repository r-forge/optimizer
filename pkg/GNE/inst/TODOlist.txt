=== GNE: computation of Nash Equilibria ===

Version 0.97
=============

- semismooth equation
	- local methods are Newton, Broyden, Levenberg-Marquardt.
	- global methods are dbldog, pwldog, qline, gline, none.
	- for Levenberg-Marquardt, none is mandatory and LM.param=adaptive is possible
	- use latest features of nleqslv.
- constrained equation
	- local methods are IP
	- global methods are qline, gline, none
- minimisation problem
	- classic optim
	- contrained optimization by alabama
	- needed BB, CG method?
	- use latest features of BB.
- fixed-point problem
	- methods are pure, UR, vH, RRE, MPE
	- squaring SqRRE and SqMPE
