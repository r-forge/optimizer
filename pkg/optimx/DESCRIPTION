Description: REMOVED. See optplus for R-forge version of optimx. This allows
        you to have both development and distribution versions of optimx 
        installed at the same time. Use require( [name] ) to choose which one.
        Provides a replacement and extension of the optim() function to unify
	and streamline optimization capabilities in R for smooth, possibly box 
	constrained functions of several or many parameters. The package wraps a
        number of tools for function minimization available as contributed R packages.
