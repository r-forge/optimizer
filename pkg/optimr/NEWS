NEWS about R package optimz

TODO
      o Troubles with NAMESPACE collisions NOT resolved. (nloptr ??)
      o Unable to get nloptr to handle parameter scaling or dot arguments
      o Consider how the hyperbolic transformation (transfinite fn)
        could be used in all unconstrained methods
      o How can transfinite be made to work when start is on bounds?
	To work when end is on bounds?
      o Rcgmin seems to report reset of parameters to bounds when parameter
        is apparently on the bound. Could have rounding issues, and should
        avoid this warning if it is really not needed.
      o Add nloptr methods -- there are a number and we need to choose how
	to do so. 
      o Do NOT add ipoptr until non-standard install is fixed up.
      o Need to check that scaling of bounds is correct.
      o Put axsearch() in the package, along with a test.
      o hjkb does not seem to be working with bt.f etc.
      o trig1507.R issue of bounds to avoid multiple minima, note ttrig8b lbfgsb3 etc.
      o jonesrun L-BFGS-B failure!
      o grchk() -- can it be cleaned up
      o Check that controls do not conflict, e.g., maximize and fnscale. Note that
        maximize is NOT in optim() call.
      o Put counters in efn, egr ??
      o Demos still refer to optimx -- must be changed -- 160628 moved off to Roptimtest/current/
      o rename package to optimr for optimR(eplacement)

Done as of 160624, but still in progress
      o Problems with lbfgs package (unconstrained)
      o test parameter scaling (but this could be improved)

VERSION 2016-05-30
      o Crude setting of uobyqa and newuoa for control rhobeg.
        Especially when parameters all 0, or bounds undefined, program 
	will fail so we need to set this. May also be needed for rhoend.

VERSION 2016-01-07
      o realized control rhobeg needed to be set or bobyqa would fail.

VERSION 2015-12-20
      o first stable version
