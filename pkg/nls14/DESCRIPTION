Description: nls14 provides tools for working with nonlinear least squares problems.
      It is intended to eventually supercede the nls() function in the R distribution.
      For example, nls() specifically does NOT deal with small or zero
      residual problems. Its Gauss-Newton method frequently stops with 'singular 
	gradient' messages.
