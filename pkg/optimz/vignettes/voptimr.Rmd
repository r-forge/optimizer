**optimr** is a package intended to provide improved and extended 
function minimization tools for R. Such facilities are
commonly referred to as "optimization", but the original `optim()`
function and its replacement in this package, which has the
same name as the package, namely `optimr()`,
only allow for the minimization or maximization of nonlinear functions of
multiple parameters subject to at most bounds constraints. Some methods
also permit fixed (masked) parameters, which could be considered
as equal upper and lower bounds, though that is a VERY bad way 
to implement masks. In general, we wish to find the
vector of parameters `bestpar` that minimize an objective
function specified by an
R function `fn(par, ... )` where `par` is the general
vector of parameters, initially provided as the vector start, and 
the dot arguments are additional information needed to compute the function.
Function minimization methods may require information on the gradient or 
Hessian of the function, which we will identify as 
`gr(par, ...)` and `hess(par, ....)`. 

##How the optimr() function works

`optimr()` is an aggregation of wrappers for a number of individual function
minimization ("optimization") tools available for R. The individual
wrappers are selected by a sequence of `if()` statements using the argument
`method` in the call to `optimr()`. 

To add a new optimizer, we need in general terms to carry out the following:

* Ensure the new function is available, that is, the package containing it
is installed;
* Add an appropriate `if()` statement to select the new "method";
* Translate the `control` list elements of `optimr()`
into the corresponding control arguments (possibly not in a list of that name
but in one or more other structures, or even arguments or environment variables)
for the new "method";
* If necessary, redefine the R function or functions to compute the 
value of the function, gradient and possibly Hessian of the objective function
so that the output is suited to the method at hand.
* When derivative information is required by a method, we may also 
need to incorporate the possibility of numerical 
approximations to the derivative information. 
* Add code to check for situations where the new method cannot be applied, and
in such cases return a result with appropriate diagnostic information so that the
user can either adjust the inputs or else choose a different method.
\end{itemize}


\section{Adjusting the objective function}

The method `nlm()` provides a good example of a situation where the default
`fn()` and `gr()` are inappropriate to the method to be added to `optimr()`.
Don't forget the dot arguments!


```
  nlmfn <- function(spar, ...){
     f <- efn(spar, ...)
     g <- egr(spar, ...)
     attr(f,"gradient") <- g
     attr(f,"hessian") <- NULL # ?? maybe change later
     f
  }
```

In the present `optimr()`, the definition of `nlmfn` is put near the top of 
`optimr()` and it is always loaded. It is the author's understanding that such
functions will always be loaded/interpreted no matter where they are in the 
code of a function. For ease of finding the code, I have put it near the top, as
the structure can be then shared across several similar optimizers. There are 
other methods that compute the objective function and gradient at the same set of
parameters. Though `nlm()` can make use of Hessian information, we have chosen
here to omit the computation of the Hessian.
