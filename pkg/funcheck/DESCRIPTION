Description: This package is obsolete and should not be used.
        Provides a way to check the file fname.R that contains various functions that
	compute the objective function, gradient, Hessian, residuals, Jacobian, Jacobian second 
	derivatives and setup for functions used to test optimization routines. A second function
        funtest allows the individual function names to be given. Redated to force R-forge build.
