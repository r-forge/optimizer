Changes in optextras

Changes before 2012-5-26 not recorded 

TODOS

   o    The optsp environment is only currently used
        with the simple numerical gradient approximations.
        It needs to be added to ufn, ugr, uhess and some
        other routines. 

   o    Need to check that other packages can use the
        optsp environment, e.g., Rtn.

Changes

2013-8-20
   o    optsp scratchpad environment added. Note that it
        is aliased in grfwd to avoid a warning in R CMD
        check.

   o    Can change this in numerical derivative routines
        in case of parallel running.

2012-7-18
   o    Extracted helper routines from optplus to 
        create optextras package to put on CRAN.
        Formerly in optplus or optfntools on R-forge,
        but difficulties with dependencies indicated
        that the support routines need to be on CRAN.
        Renamed to avoid name confusion.

2012-7-09
   o    Suppress warnings in ugHgenb -- too much
        unhelpful output
   o    Fixed optansout to print parameters

2012-6-07
   o    Merged optfntools into optplus to ensure 
        R-forge build.

2012-5-26
   o    Added check for "on a bound" in bmchk to aid
	in use of tanh() transformation as in nmkb().
