Description: Provides a replacement and extension of the optim()
    function to call to several function minimizers in R in a single
    statement. These methods handle smooth, possibly box constrained functions 
    of several or many parameters. Note that function 'optimr()' was prepared to
    simplify the incorporation of minimizers going forward.
