Known problems 

   o	Very occassionally (about 1 in 1000 in monte carlo experiments) the
	algorithm gets stuck and does not improve (so does not converge). The
	workaround is to restart with a very slightly perturbed starting point.       

Changes in GPArotation version 2014.11-1

   o	Minor format and cleanup required by CRAN checks, no real changes.

Changes in GPArotation version 2012.3-1

   o	no real changes, but bumping version for new CRAN suitability check.

Changes in GPArotation version 2011.11-1

   o	updated maintainer email address.

Changes in GPArotation version 2011.10-1

   o	Modification to vgQ.target to allow NA in target, which is replaced by
   	0.0 (from William Revelle).

   o	Added bifactorT and bifactorQ (biquartimin) from William Revelle.

Changes in GPArotation version 2010.07-1

   o	Fix an error caused by an exact initial setting (from William Revelle).

Changes in GPArotation version 2009.02-2

   o	Standardized NEWS format for new function news().


Changes in GPArotation version 2009.02-1

   o	minor documentation corrections as found by a new R-devel.


Changes in GPArotation version 2008.05-1

   o	added echelon rotation.

   o	added gradient Gq to result list from  GPForth and GPFoblq.

   o	change license from "GPL-2" to "GPL-2 or later".

 
Changes in GPArotation version 2007.06-1

   o	fixed a couple of lingering $Lh (in print and summary methods) that should
	have been changed to $loadings.


Changes in GPArotation version 2007.04-1

   o	removed an extra comma in c() that caused a test failure with R-2.5.0

   o	added eiv rotation.
    
   o	renamed $Lh in the result from GPForth and GPFoblq to $loadings. As a
	result, rotation methods calling these function no longer need to rename
	this element in order to work with factanal and other programs. (It is a
	good idea to use the extractor function loadings() rather than refer
	directly to object structure.)

   o	changed rotation method functions to return all elements of GPFoblq and
	GFForth.

   o	fixed the documentation file primary alias for all rotations (which was 
	being called oblimin).
      

Changes in GPArotation version 2006.2-2

   o	extra argument (...) to invisible in print.GPArotation was removed.
  

Changes in GPArotation version 2006.2-1

   o	broken references in documentation were fixed and updated.


Changes in GPArotation version 2005.10-1

   o	warning message about non-convergence expanded to indicate function.  
  

GPArotation version 2005.4-1

   o	First released version.
