To do:

Look at fnDeriv:  producing a function.
 name current fnDeriv as something like evalDeriv. DONE (used codeDeriv as name)
 
Look into ways of getting variables. ..., env, data, etc.

Nice filter function to handle user input.  John will suggest names.

Fail for two-sided formula.  NOT DONE -- this is actually pretty tricky.  Just documented what it does.  To do it, we could add
special functions .Warning() and .Error() to be used as return
values from derivative definitions which trigger warnings or errors
if a user attempts specific forms.  Not worth it?

Get R CMD check working. DONE
