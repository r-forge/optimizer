Changes before 2012-4-30 not recorded 

TODOS
   o    Eventually include different line searches, possibly in a
        separate routine

2018-11-27
   o    Include cgxu to document Rcgminu as much as possible

2018-11-08
   o    Thanks to Florian Schwendinger for noting that the condition
          (f < min(fmin, f1)) 
        can evaluate to NA if f evaluates to NaN. Changed to
        isTRUE((f < min(fmin, f1)))). 

2014-7-17
   o    Changed default of control$checkgrad to FALSE. Changed error message
	that mentions Rvmmin to Rcgmin.

2013-9-24 
   o    Warning that parameter moved to bound suppressed when start
        is on the bound.

   o    Allow quoted gradient names to bring in different gradient 
        routines. Also to allow gradient approximation step to be
	adjusted.

   o    Dependency on optextras rather than numDeriv
