To do

   o    The examples in ./inst/examples/ are calling routines that
        have been renamed. These need to be fixed.

   o    nlfb() needs an explicit Jacobian function and needs a way
        to compute numerical Jacobian if omitted.

Changes in nlmrt version 2012-6.01

   o    Removed diagnostic printout of bdmsk in nlfb

Changes in nlmrt version 2012-4.15 
	   
   o	Added nlfb to allow functions for residual and Jacobian.
        These are developed from the expression for the residuals as
	a model in nlxb. 

   o	Bounds now in wrapnls.

   o	Note misleading trace output in nls() runs with bounds.
