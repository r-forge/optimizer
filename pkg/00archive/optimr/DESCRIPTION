Description: Provides a replacement and extension of the optim()
    function to unify and streamline optimization capabilities in R
    and the R package universe 
    for smooth, possibly box constrained functions of several or
    many parameters. optimr is a refactoring of the optimx package
    to simplify maintenance and extension. A great deal of this 
    package is derived from the earlier package 'optimx', but
    some functionality has been separated into distinct functions
    to allow for easier maintenance and use, as well as future
    development.
