NEWS about R package optimr (formerly optimz in R-forge)

TODO
      o Need to check that scaling of bounds is correct. IT IS CURRENTLY WRONG --
	call methods with spar, but bounds.
        Create a test function that is simple but bounded and scaled badly
      o Drop nmkb from methods for bounds if start is on bound
      o Troubles with NAMESPACE collisions NOT resolved. (nloptr ??)
      o Unable to get nloptr to handle parameter scaling or dot arguments
      o Consider how the hyperbolic transformation (transfinite fn)
        could be used in all unconstrained methods
      o How can transfinite be made to work when start is on bounds?
	To work when end is on bounds?
      o Rcgmin seems to report reset of parameters to bounds when parameter
        is apparently on the bound. Could have rounding issues, and should
        avoid this warning if it is really not needed.
      o Add nloptr methods -- there are a number and we need to choose how
	to do so. 
      o Do NOT add ipoptr until non-standard install is fixed up.
      o Put axsearch() in the package, along with a test.
      o hjkb does not seem to be working with bt.f etc.
      o trig1507.R issue of bounds to avoid multiple minima, note ttrig8b lbfgsb3 etc.
      o jonesrun L-BFGS-B failure!
      o grchk() -- can it be cleaned up
      o Check that controls do not conflict, e.g., maximize and fnscale. Note that
        maximize is NOT in optim() call.
      o Put counters in efn, egr ??
      o Make sure routines in optextras are same as those in optimr (or call optextras)
      o replace coef.optimx with ???
      o import from optextras


VERSION 2016-06-28
      o rename package to optimr for optimR(eplacement)
      o Problems with lbfgs package (unconstrained) resolved
      o test parameter scaling (but this could be improved)
      o Demos still refer to optimx -- must be changed -- 160628 moved off to Roptimtest/current/

VERSION 2016-05-30
      o Crude setting of uobyqa and newuoa for control rhobeg.
        Especially when parameters all 0, or bounds undefined, program 
	will fail so we need to set this. May also be needed for rhoend.

VERSION 2016-01-07
      o realized control rhobeg needed to be set or bobyqa would fail.

VERSION 2015-12-20
      o first stable version
