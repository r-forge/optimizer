2013-8-18
   o    ?? about optderiveps setting

2012-7-18
   o    Extracted helper routines from optplus to 
        create optextras package to put on CRAN.
        Formerly in optplus or optfntools on R-forge,
        but difficulties with dependencies indicated
        that the support routines need to be on CRAN.
        Renamed to avoid name confusion.

2012-7-09
   o    Suppress warnings in ugHgenb -- too much
        unhelpful output
   o    Fixed optansout to print parameters

2012-6-07
   o    Merged optfntools into optplus to ensure 
        R-forge build.

2012-5-26
   o    Added check for "on a bound" in bmchk to aid
	in use of tanh() transformation as in nmkb().
