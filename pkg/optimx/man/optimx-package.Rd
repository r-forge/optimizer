\title{
A replacement and extension of the optim() function
}
\description{
\code{\link{optimx}}
provides a replacement and extension of the \code{link{optim()}} function to 
unify and streamline optimization capabilities in R for smooth, possibly box
constrained functions of several or many parameters

The three functions ufn, ugr and uhess wrap corresponding user functions fn, gr, and 
hess so that these functions can be executed safely (via try()) and also so parameter or
function scaling can be applied. The wrapper
functions also allow for maximization of functions (via minimization of the negative of
the function) using the logical parameter \code{maximize}.

There are three test functions, fnchk, grchk, and hesschk, to allow the user 
function to be tested for validity and correctness. However, no set of tests is 
exhaustive, and extensions and improvements are welcome. The package 
\code{numDeriv} is used for generation of numerical approximations to 
derivatives.
Examples can be found on the \code{\link{optimx}} help page and in the 
demo directory, \code{demo(package = "optimx")}.
