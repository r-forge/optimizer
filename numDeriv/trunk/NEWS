            Changes in numDeriv version 2008.9-1

  o argument zero.tol was added to gad, jacobian and genD, and is used to test
    if parameters are zero in order to determine if eps should be used in place
    of d.  Previous tests using == did not work for very small values.

  o Some documentation links to [stats]numericDeriv mistakenly called 
     numericalDeriv were fixed.  
  

                  numDeriv version 2006.4-1

  o  First released version.
