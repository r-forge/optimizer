Changes in nlmrt version 2012-4.17 
	   
   o	Added nlfb to allow functions for residual and Jacobian.
        These are developed from the expression for the residuals as
	a model in nlxb. 

   o	Bounds now in wrapnls.

   o	Note misleading trace output in nls() runs with bounds. The objective
        function is 0.5*sum_of_squares.
