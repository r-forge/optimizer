150709: - optimr -- need to sort out counts for methods





150708:

- problems with saving to ans.ret[meth, ] for single method. Need to fix
- Note that trace > 0 does not seem to be transferred to optim
  In fact, fn and gr are seemingly not transferred correctly. Something seriously wrong.

150709:

- setup of ufn, ugr -- worked using optest package. Found it too easy to make mistakes.
- optimr: a replacement for optim that returns single method output with hessian NULL.
   This should allow optimx to be a loop wrapper and call this using ufn and ugr so we
   avoid lots of the internal stuff (though the overhead will still be there in general).
- Note lots of ?? re Imports and Namespace. Need to learn this better.
- optimr -- parameter scaling
  How: spar <- par / pscale    Scaled parameters (over which we optimize)

       par <- spar*pscale      Unscaled parameters

       sfn(spar, ...) = fn(par, ...) = fn(spar*pscale, ...)

       How do we communicate the pscale  (= control$parscale for optim)

       Maybe use control$parscale and default it to rep(1, npar)
