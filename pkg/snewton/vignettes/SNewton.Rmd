# Safeguarded Newton algorithms

So-called **Newton** methods are among the most commonly mentioned in the solution of nonlinear
equations or function minimization. However, as discussed in 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method#History,
the **Newton** or **Newton-Raphson** method as we know it today was not what either of its
supposed originators knew.

This vignette discusses the development of a simple safeguarded variant of the Newton method for 
function minimization in **R**. Note that there are some resources in **R** for solving 
nonlinear equations by Newton-like methods in the packages **nleqslv** and **pracma**. 

# The basic approach

If we have a function $f(x)$, with gradient $g(x)$ and second derivative (Hessian) $H(x)$
the first order condition for an extremum (min or max) is  

$g(x) = 0$

To ensure a minimum, we want 

$ H(x) > 0 $

The first order condition leads to a root-finding problem.

It turns out that $x$ need not be a scalar. We can consider it to be a vector of 
parameters to be determined. This renders $g(x)$ a vector also, and $H(x)$ a matrix.
The conditions of optimality then require a zero gradient and positive-definite Hessian.

The Newton approach to such 
equations is to provide a guess to the root $x_try$ and to then solve the equation

$ H(x_t) * s = - g(x_t)$

for the search vector $s$. We update $x_t$ to $x_t + s$ and repeat until we have 
a very small gradient $g(x_t)$. If $H(x)$ is positive definite, we have a reasonable
approximation to a (local) minimum. 

# Motivations

A particular interest in Newton-like methods its theoretical quadratic convergence. See
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method.
That is, the method will converge in one step for a quadratic function $f(x)$, and for "reasonable"
functions will converge very rapidly. There are, however, a number of conditions, and practical
programs need to include safequards against mis-steps in the iterations.

The principal issues concern the possiblity that $H(x)$ may not be positive definite, at least
in some parts of the domain, and that the curvature may be such that a unit step $x_t + s$
does not reduce the function $f$. We therefore get a number of possible variants of the 
method when different possible safeguards are applied.

# Algorithm possibilities

There are many choices we can make in building a practical code to implement the ideas
above. In tandem with the two main issues expressed above, we will consider

   - the modification of the solution of the main equation $ H(x_t) * s = - g(x_t)$ so
   that a reasonable search vector $s$ is always generated
   
   - the selection of a new set of parameters $x_new = x_t + step * s$ so that the
   function value $f(x_new)$ is less than $f(x_t)$.
   
The second choice above could be made slightly more stringent so that the Armijo (??ref)
condition  of sufficient-decrease is met. Adding a curvature requirement gives the 
Wolfe condisions. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfe_conditions. The Armijo requirement
is generally written

$f(x_t + step*s) < f(x_t) + c * step * g(x_t)^T*s$

where c is some number less than 1. Typically $ c = 1e-4 = 0.0001 $. Note that the product
of gradient times search vector is negative for any reasonable situation, since we are 
trying to go "downhill".

# A choice to compute the search vector

The primary concern in solving for $s$ is that the Hessian may not be positive definite. 
This means that we cannot apply fast and stable methods like the Cholesky decomposition
to the matrix. At the time of writing, we use the following approach:

  - We attempt to solve $ H(x_t) * s = - g(x_t)$ with **R** directly, and rely on internal
  checks to catch any cases where the solution fails. We then use `try()` to stop the
  program in this case.
  
# Choosing the step size

The traditional Newton approach is that the stepsize is taken to be 1. In practice,
this can sometimes mean that the function value is not reduced. As an alternative,
we use a simple backtrack search. We start with $step = 1$ (actually the program 
allows for the element `defstep` of the `control` list to be set to a value other
than 1). If the Armijo condition is not met, we replace $step$ with $ r * step $ 
where $r$ is less than 1. Here we suggest `control$stepdec = 0.2`. We repeat until 
$x_t$ satisfies the Armijo condition or $x_t$ is essentially unchanged by the step.

Here "essentially unchanged" is determined by a test using an offset value, that is,
the test 

$   (x_t + offset) == (x_t + step * d + offset) $ 

where $d$ is the search direction. `control$offset = 100` is used. 

# Examples

## A simple example


## The Rosenbrock function


## The Wood function


Note that we have NOT found the minimum for the Wood function.
