                 Known problems 

  o Very occassionally (about 1 in 1000 in monte carlo experiments) the
     algorithm gets stuck and does not improve (so does not converge). The
     workaround is to restart with a very slightly perturbed starting point.       


            Changes in GPArotation version 200x.x-x

  o renamed $Lh in the result from GPForth and GPFoblq to $loadings. As a
    result, rotation methods calling these function no longer need to rename
    this element in order to work with factanal and other programs. (It is a
    good idea to use the extractor function loadings() rather than refer
    directly to object structure.)

  o changed rotation method functions to return all elements of GPFoblq and
    GFForth.

  o fixed the documentation file primary alias for all rotations (which was 
     being called oblimin).
      

            Changes in GPArotation version 2006.2-2
