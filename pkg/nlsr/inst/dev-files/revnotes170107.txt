Notes on review of nlsr package Jan 2017 by JN 

- added detailed output to dex() examples that show different classes of the returned objects.

- made clear where the .MissingVal usage is to be found in Rd file for nlsDeriv.

- in nlsr-devdoc.Rmd added silly joe(x) example to show possible trouble spot

170108
- removed dot args from nlxb declaration and its internal call to nlfb(),
  and fixed nlxb.Rd. Note nls() help says of dot args "None are used at present."
  
- moved model2rjfunx and .Rd file to inst/dev-files

- should we add weights to nlxb? nlfb? Note that nlfb() can use functionally
  created weights, but nls uses FIXED weights. We could add fixed weights to 
  nlxb() and pass to nlfb() via its dot args.
