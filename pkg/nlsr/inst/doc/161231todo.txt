To do:

Look at fnDeriv:  producing a function.
 name current fnDeriv as something like evalDeriv. DONE (used codeDeriv as name)
 
Look into ways of getting variables. ..., env, data, etc.

Nice filter function to handle user input.  John will suggest names.
  ?? WHat about dex() for Derivative EXpression. It doesn't seem to be used. 


Fail for two-sided formula.  NOT DONE -- this is actually pretty tricky.  
Just documented what it does.  To do it, we could add
special functions .Warning() and .Error() to be used as return
values from derivative definitions which trigger warnings or errors
if a user attempts specific forms.  Not worth it?

JN: I agree that it isn't worth doing at this level of effort. Maybe we
just note that using our function on a 2-sided formula has possibly undefined
consequences.??

Get R CMD check working. DONE
JN: Still getting same error on Linux Mint 18. ?? 
    I'll keep looking into this and see if I can find source of issue.
