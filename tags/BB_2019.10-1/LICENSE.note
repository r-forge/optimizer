The BB package implements all algorithms in R and contains none of the 
original Fortran.

Prior versions of the spg algorithm, written in Fortran, are licensed under 
GPL version 2 or later and are available at the TANGO project 
<http://www.ime.usp.br/~egbirgin/tango/downloads.php>

The original sane and dfsane algorithms were published in Fortran by 
Marcos Raydan and co-authors, who have release their Fortran code 
under GPL version 3.
