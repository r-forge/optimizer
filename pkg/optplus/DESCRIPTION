Title: A wrapper for optimization methods (function minimization with at most bounds and masks).
Author: John C Nash <nashjc@uottawa.ca>
Maintainer: John C Nash <nashjc@uottawa.ca>
Description: A wrapper for running many optimization tools. These are primarily 
   function minimization methods with at most bounds and masks on the parameters.
   By calls to optextras, provides a way to check the basic computation of objective 
   functions that the user provides, along with proposed gradient and Hessian 
   functions, as well as to wrap such functions to avoid failures when 
   inadmissible parameters are provided. Check bounds and masks.
   Check scaling or optimality conditions. Perform an axial search to seek lower points on the 
   objective function surface. Includes forward, central and backward gradient approximation codes.
