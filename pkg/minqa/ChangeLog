        * DESCRIPTION (Version): New minor version number

	* R/minqa.R fix npt to min(n+2, 2*n) in call

2011-02-02  Douglas Bates  <bates@stat.wisc.edu>

	* DESCRIPTION (Version): New minor version number

	* src/minqa.cpp (calfun): check for finite value of objective
	function.

2011-01-27  Douglas Bates  <bates@stat.wisc.edu>

	* src/minqa.cpp: Expand RCPP_FUNCTION_X macros to make debugging
	easier. 

2010-11-19  Douglas Bates  <bates@stat.wisc.edu>

	* src/Makevars (PKG_LIBS): Change to the backticks version

2010-11-14  Douglas Bates  <bates@stat.wisc.edu>

	* tests/newuoa.R: added test for newuoa which should signal an
	error.

	* src/minqa.cpp: reverted the removal of the ierr argument in
	calls to Fortran code.

2010-08-10  John Nash  <nashjc@uottawa.ca>
        * man/bobyqa.Rd: Added revised codes for error exits and
	tests for some of these errors. Note that the error for npt
	(number of interpolation points) out of desired range does not
	work. It appears the minqa.R code forces a valid setting, and
	ignores user input.

        * man/newuoa.Rd: Added revised codes for error exits and
	tests for some of these errors. Note that the error for npt
	(number of interpolation points) out of desired range does not
	work. It appears the minqa.R code forces a valid setting, and
	ignores user input.

        * man/uobyqa.Rd: Added revised codes for error exits and
	tests for some of these errors. 

        * src/uobyq*.f: Put in IERR exits and suppressed minqer() call.
	Also put IERR in calling sequence.

        * src/newuo*.f: Put in IERR exits and suppressed minqer() call.
	Also put IERR in calling sequence.

        * src/minqa.cpp: Put in IERR for newuoa and uobyqa. This involves
	several changes, including * and & modifiers to variables.

2010-08-09  Douglas Bates  <bates@stat.wisc.edu>

	* man/bobyqa.Rd: Add a check on the error code.  (Note: the R code
	should be modified to look for the error code in the returned
	value and produce an appropriate error message.)

	* src/minqa.cpp: pass ierr in call to rval from bobyqa.  (Had it
	defined previously but forgot to pass it.)

	* tests/rvaltest.R,src/bobyq*.f,src/minqa.cpp,man/bobyqa.Rd:
	Modify Fortran sources to return an error code instead of Fortran
	I/O (John Nash) and incorporate error code in interface routine.
	Modify tests accordingly. (Note: other optimizers not yet modified.)

2010-06-18  Douglas Bates  <bates@stat.wisc.edu>

	* src/minqa.cpp: "fval" component of returned list is now directly
	the function evaluation and not conversion to double and back to
	NumericVector.  In particular, attributes are not stripped.

	* tests/rvaltest.R: Modify test to ignore attributes (including
	the dimensions).

	* DESCRIPTION: New release.

2010-03-14  Douglas Bates  <bates@stat.wisc.edu>

	* src/*.f: Cleaned up more PRINT statements.  Changed CALL CALFUN
	to F = CALFUN().

	* src/minqa.cpp: Moved the C++ code to this file name (previously
	was bobyqa_cpp.cpp).  Re-arranged order of functions and added
	documentation.  Changed CALFUN to a function incorporating the
	minqi3 output.

	* man/*.Rd: Updates and modifications to examples

	* R/minimizers.R: Added print methods for each of the class

2010-03-13  Douglas Bates  <bates@stat.wisc.edu>

	* src/main.f: removed - R packages should not contain a main
	program

	* src/<many files>: Removed C functions; Changed to C++ with Rcpp;
	Added Makevars.

	* R/<many files>: inlined the foo.control functions, amalgamated
	sources, switched to C++ .Call functions.

	* man/<many files>: Removed docs for newly inlined functions.

	* DESCRIPTION: New version

	* NAMESPACE: UseDynLibs to access names of functions for .Call

2010-03-11  Douglas Bates  <bates@stat.wisc.edu>

	* R/bobyqa.R, src/bobyqa_c.c: Change default argument
	handling and interface between R and C code.  Remove
	bobyqa.control R function.

	* man/bobyqa.Rd: Update to new organization.  Fix R CMD check
	problems.
