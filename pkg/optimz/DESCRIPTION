Description: Provides a replacement and extension of the optim()
        function to unify and streamline optimization capabilities in R
        for smooth, possibly box constrained functions of several or
        many parameters. This is the CRAN version of the package.
	Note that Rtnmin should be suggested when that package is debugged.
