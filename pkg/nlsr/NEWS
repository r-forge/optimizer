To do

161019   o    Changed names nlsrxb and nlsrfb to nlxb and nlfb and removed
              superfluous nlfb.

161018   o    Problem with vignettes (why?). optimx is needed (why?)

161007   o    Sort out nlsrxb to use Deriv vs deriv (vs Deriv from French) ??

161007   o    Note the ?? in all the codes. Simplify!

161007   o    More detailed build of rjfun to use approximations when derivs
		not available.

161007   o    Simple GN code needed to show what happens -- should be able
        to write a VERY simple one for the vignette. Possibly not include
        in the code of nlsr.

   o    Origin of NaN's in bounded examples. Can they be avoided?
	Handling of NaN in Jacfun ?? Need an example.

   o    Does it make sense to have unconstrained version of nlfb
	when there are no masks or bounds?

   o    Rename modss, modgr to res2ss, res2gr

   o    Option for numerical Jacobian -- control numJac = TRUE?, with
	routine in nlmrt.R ?? elsewhere.
	Way of using a "gradient" attribute when the model formula is
        specified like  
           y ~ SpecialFn(xx, zz)
        which would allow functions not differentiable by deriv()

   o    Weighted least squares example, especially in nlxb.

   o    Issue when npar = 1 -- does it work?

   o    check and fix examples?  Partly done 140719
	tests?

   o    check impact of use of Deriv vs deriv and document!

   o    make sure change to rjfun using "gradient" is clean in nlsrxb

   o    partially linear nls models. How to incorporate? Note Rust and Oleary.

   o    nlsr when it exceeds fn or jac count, returns bad solutions that won't print.

Changes in nlsr version 2016-10.3

    o   name change to nlsr and consequent changes

    o   minor fixes

Changes in nlsr version 2014-7.28


Changes in nlsr version 2014-7.27

   o    Deriv() etc.

   o    model2rjfun() etc. 

   o    changes to nlsrxb structure

Changes in nlsr version 2014-7.19

   o    The parameters MUST be named when setting up model2resfun etc.,
	but the resulting function can be called with an un-named
	vector of parameters.

   o    Name reset to reflect intent to substitute for nls()

   o    wrapnls replaced by wrapnlsr

   o    use of ... args replaced with data = mydata (dataframe)

   o    1-sided models which start with the tilde are now allowed in
	nlsr functions.

Changes in nlmrt version 2013-8.26

   o    Relative offset convergence test (not exactly as in nls())
        residual and jacobian in summary & print methods

   o    coef() method in nlmrt.R so names carried through

   o    summary() and print() cleanup

   o    partial and minor documentation improvement

Changes in nlmrt version 2013-8.10

   o    fix line length issue in examples

Changes in nlmrt version 2013-7.9

   o    Added control list elements to .Rd files for nlxb and nlfb, 
        with reference in wrapnls.

   o    Put in a test for very small sum of squares in nlfb and nlxb.

Changes in nlmrt version 2013-3.16

   o    Result element coeffs changed to coefficients. 
        This alters wrapnls.R code also.

Changes in nlmrt version 2012-9.03

   o    More features in summary().

Changes in nlmrt version 2012-9.03

   o    summary() for output from different functions.
        Should display constraints if possible as per JNMWS codes.
        Warnings / Notes fixed re: dependencies in vignette, methods.

   o    Sort out display in vignette
        Note warning "unstated dependencies in vignette"

Changes in nlmrt version 2012-8.12

   o    Bounds and masks examples in nlmrt-vignette.

Changes in nlmrt version 2012-8.04
   o    Vignette nlmrt-vignette updated.

   o    Functions to convert expression to residual, Jacobian,
        sum of squares and gradient functions (for use with optimx
        or nlmrt:nlfb or minpack.lm:nls.lm

   o    The examples in ./inst/examples/ are calling routines that
        have been renamed. These have, I believe, been fixed.

   o    nlfb() needs an explicit Jacobian function and needs a way
        to compute numerical Jacobian if omitted. Fixed, I believe.

Changes in nlmrt version 2012-6.01

   o    Removed diagnostic printout of bdmsk in nlfb

Changes in nlmrt version 2012-4.15 
	   
   o	Added nlfb to allow functions for residual and Jacobian.
        These are developed from the expression for the residuals as
	a model in nlxb. 

   o	Bounds now in wrapnls.

   o	Note misleading trace output in nls() runs with bounds.
