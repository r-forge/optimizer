Title: A set of tools to support optimization methods
      (function minimization with at most bounds and masks).
Author: John C Nash <nashjc@uottawa.ca>
Maintainer: John C Nash <nashjc@uottawa.ca>
Description: Tools to assist in safely applying user generated objective and derivative function 
   to optimization programs. These are primarily function minimization methods 
   with at most bounds and masks on the parameters.
   Provides a way to check the basic computation of objective functions that 
   the user provides, along with proposed gradient and Hessian functions, as well as to wrap such 
   functions to avoid failures when inadmissible parameters are provided. Check bounds and masks.
   Check scaling or optimality conditions. Perform an axial search to seek lower points on the 
   objective function surface. Includes forward, central and backward gradient approximation codes.
