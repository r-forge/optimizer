Title: Tools for assisting the preparation and testing of objective functions for optimization.
Author: John C Nash <nashjc@uottawa.ca>
Maintainer: John C Nash <nashjc@uottawa.ca>
Description: Tools to assist in safely applying user generated objective and derivative function 
   to optimization programs. Provides a way to check the basic computation of objective functions that 
   the user provides, along with proposed gradient and Hessian functions, as well as to wrap such 
   functions to avoid failures when inadmissible parameters are provided. Check bounds and masks.
   Check scaling or optimality conditions.
