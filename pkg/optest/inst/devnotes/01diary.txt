Done:
150709: - optimr -- need to sort out counts for methods
150710: - need to adjust bounds for parscale	
	- the optest function more or less works. We can create the cfg using setup, and
	  the scaled fn and gr work fine in optim() and Rvmmin and Rcgmin with minor setup
	  issues. BUT running in optest seems to fail for Rcgmin (did not try Rvmmin, but 
	  suspect also)
	  Got op working -- but not tested for bounds.




150708:

- problems with saving to ans.ret[meth, ] for single method. Need to fix
- Note that trace > 0 does not seem to be transferred to optim
  In fact, fn and gr are seemingly not transferred correctly. Something seriously wrong.

150709:

- setup of ufn, ugr -- worked using optest package. Found it too easy to make mistakes.
- optimr: a replacement for optim that returns single method output with hessian NULL.
   This should allow optimx to be a loop wrapper and call this using ufn and ugr so we
   avoid lots of the internal stuff (though the overhead will still be there in general).
- Note lots of ?? re Imports and Namespace. Need to learn this better.
- optimr -- parameter scaling
  How: spar <- par / pscale    Scaled parameters (over which we optimize)

       par <- spar*pscale      Unscaled parameters

       sfn(spar, ...) = fn(par, ...) = fn(spar*pscale, ...)

       How do we communicate the pscale  (= control$parscale for optim)

       Maybe use control$parscale and default it to rep(1, npar)

150710: 

- optest.check seems to fail at fnchk, but fnchk works on its own. Weird.
