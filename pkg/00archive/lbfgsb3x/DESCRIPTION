Description: Interfacing to Nocedal et al. L-BFGS-B.3.0 (2011 <doi:10.1145/2049662.2049669>) limited
	memory BFGS minimizer with bounds on parameters. This is a fork of 'lbfgsb3'.  This
	registers a 'R' compatible 'C' interface to L-BFGS-B.3.0 that uses the same function types
	and optimization as the optim() function (see writing 'R' extensions and source for
	details).  Ths package also adds more stopping criterion as well as allows adjusting more tolerances.
