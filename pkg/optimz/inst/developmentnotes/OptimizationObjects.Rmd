# Introduction

These are notes describing a proposal for "optimization objects", a format
to unify the inputs and outputs from optimization functions.

Annotations: JN: means John Nash has commented. JN??: he has a query or wants 
    comments. Similarly for other commentators.

Currently base R has many different optimizers (`optim()`, `nls()`, `nlm()`, etc.)
each with different strengths, but also each with different requirements for 
inputs.  The `optimx` and `optimz` packages are an attempt to unify these
(and others) into a common interface, to make comparison of the results easier.
This proposal carries that unification further.

# General Idea

The `optimx()` (JN: suggest `optimobj()` or other different name 
to avoid confusion for current packages) 
function should accept as input an optimization object.  The
object should contain sufficient information about the optimization problem
to allow choice of an optimizer and construction of defaults for all necessary 
arguments for that optimizer.

Thus   

     ans <- optimobj(myoptopject)            (JN:)

The result `ans` should also be an optimization object.  In addition to the inputs, 
the result should contain information about the outcome of the optimization 
attempt, and perhaps a history of previous attempts.  (There needs to be 
some control over the level of detail here, but it should at least be possible
to contain (JN??: obtain. I think npar=25000 with full trace will blow most R
installations. It gives a very interesting demo, as I discovered to my embarrassment,
of the swap disk going berserk.) full trace information from previous attempts.)

# Details

I am thinking about this as if the objects are implemented in S3, but
this proposal is preliminary, so all of the suggestions are tentative,
including the form of the objects.

The current idea is that there should be two kinds of objects:  
`objectiveFn` objects which represent an objective function to optimize,
and `optimization` objects which represent an optimization problem, including
the objective function, strategy for optimizing, and a record of what
has been attempted so far.

JN: Thus, 

     anoptobj <- list(objectiveFn=myobjfn, optInputs=myoptinputs, optOut=NULL)

where the NULL gets replaced with "stuff". And maybe the name is unfortunate.

We distinguish between two views of the objective function:  the user's view, and
the optimizer's view.  For example, the user may have a function of 5 variables,
but wish to fix two of them, so the optimizer's view is of a function of
3 variables.  Or the user may have a partially linear model, so the 
nonlinear optimizer only needs to modify the nonlinear parameters, and the 
linear parameters can then by estimated by linear regression.

JN: I'm very much in agreement with the spirit of this, and very much worried
how difficult it will be to do nicely. Still, we've got to try.


## The optimization object

Fields in the optimization object.  These are modelled on the arguments
to the `stats::optim` function; other optimizers may need others, so 
these can change.

JN: I've reordered these

objectiveFn

* `fn`:   An objective function object.

optInput

* `par`:  A vector of parameter values, used to initialize the optimizer.
* `method`:  A vector of names of optimization methods to try. (JN: I use this singular for 
   historical reasons -- i.e., optim(), but we could change it.)
* `lower`, `upper`:  Bounds on the allowable range of the parameters.
* `control`:  A list of control parameters. (JN: This can be tricky to set up "nicely".)
* `dots`:  A list of other parameters to pass to the objective function.

optOut

* `results`:  A list of results of previous attempts. JN: It would be good to figure out
the structure of this, especially how we deal with detail that a full trajectory would 
entail.

optStatus

* various informational items that report whether
    * inputs are feasible, 
    * bounds are admissible (lower <= upper), 
    * or equal bounds converted to masks (fixed parameters)
    * parameter scaling not too "extreme"
    * gradient and possibly hessian functins test OK with approximations

* Post solution checks on proposed solutions
    * kkt checks
    * axial search
    * others?


The `lower`, `upper`, `control`, and `hessian` arguments can be lists, 
with entries corresponding to the matching entry in `method`.  Currently
these are named with matching names to methods, but perhaps this should
be done as a vector, so the same method can be included multiple times
with different `control` values.  

JN: The default control list is now about a page long. Many controls are common.
However, it is important for "follow-on" cases as Duncan's example below suggests
(optimx already has this option, but the code is not as clean as I'd like.) Because
of the complexity the use of lists here involves, I believe we need to think 
carefully how we set up computations. The examples provide some suggestions, and 
we can use more to help us understand what would work well. 

JN: I regard different bounds as defining different problems. So I think `lower` and 
`upper` should only appear once. 

JN: Computing the Hessian is VERY expensive when npar gets large. I'd suggest that
it should only be calculated for the "best" result unless the user takes special steps. 
The user has the option of calling optimHess() in current optim(). 
It is actually documented there, but I think too succinctly, and
I'd argue for a documentation patch, or at least an example. 
We may also want to prepare a function that
computes it and puts the result in the right place in the optOut list.

JN: A confusion issue is that hessian is a LOGICAL input and a MATRIX output. This
could be unimportant if we use the optInput and optOut categories.

JN: Duncan's example, as I note below is a follow-on polyalgorithm. Sometimes this
is what we want. Other times we want to compare methods. So we are trying to do two
different things with the list of methods, and this gets us into trouble, especially
when we need separate controls for each of the components of a polyalgorithm.


## The objectiveFn object

This object contains the following functions.  Typically they would share
an environment where other data could be stored.

* `fn0`:  A `function(par, ...)` which is the
   user's view of the function.
* `fn1`:  A `function(par1, ...)` which is the 
   optimizer's view of the function.
* `gr0` and `gr1`:  Corresponding functions to compute the gradients.
* `hess0` and `hess1` JN??
* `forward`: A `function(par)` that converts `par` to `par1`.
* `inverse`: A `function(par1)` that converts `par1` to `par`.


## Notes on the objectiveFn object

JN: My experience is that it's (a lot) easier to work with the original length parameter
vector. Yes, the function has fewer true parameters, but the transformation is 
tedious and error prone. It is fairly straightforward for the software to deal 
with the loss of dimensionality, since a "mask" that has 0 in each place where
the parameter is fixed and 1 elsewhere will project the change vector appropriately.
This is used in the bounded methods as the parameters move and hit and leave bounds.
The transformation on each iteration would be very onerous. Since we already have
a structure for masking the constrained parameters, adding fixed parameters is
relatively straightforward.

Issue: You DO need to know the dimensionality internally. ntrue = 0 is 
trivial -- no work. ntrue = 1 can mess up some algorithms e.g., conjugate gradients. 
I suspect Nelder-Mead will do silly things too. However, we use a hyperbolic
transformation to do bounds in nmkb, but Rcgmin, Rvmmin and Rtnmin all use index
vectors and seem to manage the dimensionality when they hit upper or lower bounds,
as these reduce dimensionality too. 
  
JN: A different "internal" function is one that minimizes to compute a maximum
by multiplying user's objective by -1. There is also parameter scaling, and I
believe that this could be made efficient by use of a scaling vector passed 
through a local environment. This already exists in Rtnmin, as my brother
used Matlab globals to pass historical points and function values and 
gradients between internal routines. I believe it could be used more
generally to hold useful information about the function.

## Structure to deal with functions, gradients and Hessians

`optim()` likes fn and gr as separate entities. However, it is quite common
to find that the function and gradient code share a large proportion of their
calculations, so having them separate is wasteful. However, three logical 
controls in a special environment for optimz / nls14 could be getf, getg, 
and geth. In optimx and optimz there are conditions so that in the following
table, the top three possibilities are allowed and the bottom 5 are not.

```
       getf         getg         geth
        T             T              T
        T             T              F      
        T             F              F
      ================
        T             F              T
        F             T              F
        F             T              T
        F             F              T
        F             F              F
```

Different optimization methods take different approaches. However, it is
more common that one needs a new evaluation of the function AND gradient at
a given set of parameters than just the gradient. Only in methods like 
`trust` do we need function, gradient and Hessian. On the other hand, 
there are plenty of times when even a gradient method will ask only for
the function value. Less common is the need for gradient alone. Methods
such as `Rtnmin` and `L-BFGS-B` always calculate function and gradient
together.

`nlm` can optionally compute the gradient and hessian
as well as the function value, but puts the evaluated gradient and 
hessian into attributes of the returned object, whereas `trust`
returns them in a list.

JN: I think the idea of a single R function with multiple returns is
attractive, but we need to figure out which method is best.

A simple example suggests a small difference in favour of the attribute
approach:

```{r}
source("~/R-optimtest/testfnsR/grosenbrock/grose.R")
grose.h <- function(x, gs){
  return(NULL)
}
lfn <- function(x, ...){ # list based function
    fv <- grose.f(x, ...)
    gv <- grose.g(x, ...)
    hv <- grose.h(x, ...)
    fgh <- list(value=fv, gradient=gv, hessia=hv)
}
afn <- function(x, ...){ # attribute based function
    fv <- grose.f(x, ...)
    gv <- grose.g(x, ...)
    hv <- grose.h(x, ...)
    attribute(fv,"gradient") <- gv
    attribute(fv, "hessian") <- hv
    fv
}
require(microbenchmark)
xx<-rep(pi, 10)
microbenchmark(lfn)
microbenchmark(afn)


afgh <- function(x)
{
    gr <- function(x1, x2)
        c(-400*x1*(x2 - x1*x1) - 2*(1-x1), 200*(x2 - x1*x1))
    h <- function(x1, x2) {
        a11 <- 2 - 400*x2 + 1200*x1*x1
        a21 <- -400*x1
        matrix(c(a11, a21, a21, 200), 2, 2)
    }
    x1 <- x[1]; x2 <- x[2]
    res<- 100*(x2 - x1*x1)^2 + (1-x1)^2
    attr(res, "gradient") <- gr(x1, x2)
    attr(res, "hessian") <- h(x1, x2)
    return(res)
}

lfgh <- function(x)
{
    gr <- function(x1, x2)
        c(-400*x1*(x2 - x1*x1) - 2*(1-x1), 200*(x2 - x1*x1))
    h <- function(x1, x2) {
        a11 <- 2 - 400*x2 + 1200*x1*x1
        a21 <- -400*x1
        matrix(c(a11, a21, a21, 200), 2, 2)
    }
    x1 <- x[1]; x2 <- x[2]
    res<- 100*(x2 - x1*x1)^2 + (1-x1)^2
    lfgh <- list(value=res, gradient=gr, hessian=h)
}

microbenchmark(lfgh)
microbenchmark(afgh)

```


# Prototype

This is the kind of thing I am thinking of.  This only supports `optim`; the
real thing needs to be much more elaborate.

## Code for methods

```{r}

simpleObjective <- function(fn, gr = NULL) {
  identity <- function(par) par
  structure(list(fn0 = fn, fn1 = fn, gr0 = gr, gr1 = gr, 
  	         forward = identity, inverse = identity),
  	    class = "objectiveFn")
}

optimization <- function(par, fn, gr = NULL, ...,
      methods = knownMethods,
      lower = -Inf, upper = Inf,
      control = list(), hessian = FALSE) {
	
    if (!inherits(fn, "objectiveFn"))
      fn <- simpleObjective(fn, gr)
    
    knownMethods <- c("Nelder-Mead", "BFGS", "CG", "L-BFGS-B", "SANN",
                 "Brent") 
    
    result <- list(par = par, fn = fn,  
    	           dots = list(...), lower = lower, upper = upper,
    	           control = control, hessian = hessian)
    
    if (!missing(methods))
      result$methods <- match.arg(methods, knownMethods, several.ok = TRUE)
    else
      result$methods <- knownMethods[1]
    
    structure(result, class = "optimization")
}

print.optimization <- function(x, ...) {
  cat("Optimization object.")
  if (!is.null(x$value)) {
    cat("  fn(", paste(format(x$par), collapse=","), ") = ", 
                 format(x$value),"\n", sep="")
  } else
    cat("  Not run yet.\n")
}

run.optimization <- function (x, verbose = TRUE) {
  if (is.null(x$runs))
    x$runs <- list()
  
  if (is.null(x$value))
    x$value <- do.call(x$fn$fn0, c(list(x$par), x$dots))
  
  for (method in x$methods) {
    args <- unclass(x)
    args$method <- method
    args$methods <- NULL
    args$runs <- NULL
    args$value <- NULL
    args$dots <- NULL
    args$par <- x$fn$forward(args$par)
    args$gr <- x$fn$gr1
    args$fn <- x$fn$fn1
    
    if (is.list(args$lower)) {
    	args$lower <- x$lower[[method]]
        if (is.null(args$lower)) 
          args$lower <- -Inf
    }
    if (is.list(args$upper)) {
    	args$upper <- x$upper[[method]]
    	if (is.null(args$upper))
    	  args$upper <- Inf
    }
    if (is.list(args$control) && all(names(args$control) %in% x$methods)) {
    	args$control <- x$control[[method]]
    	if (is.null(args$control))
    	  args$control <- list()
    }
    if (is.list(args$hessian)) {
    	args$hessian <- x$hessian[[method]]
    	if (is.null(args$hessian))
    	  args$hessian <- FALSE
    }
    if (verbose)
        cat("Trying method = '", method, "'\n", sep = "")
    run <- do.call("optim", c(args, x$dots))
    x$runs <- c(x$runs, list(run))
    if (run$value < x$value) {
    	x$value <- run$value
    	x$par <- x$fn$inverse(run$par)
    	if (verbose) {
    	  cat("  ")
    	  print(x)
    	}
    } else 
    	if (verbose)
    	  cat("  No improvement.\n")
  }
  if (verbose) invisible(x)
  else x
}
```

## Simple example

Here we try it to optimize the function $(x-1)^2 + (x-y-3)^4 + 0.0001*(y-4)^4 + 1$.  I use methods SANN followed by Nelder-Mead with a limit of 20 iterations,
just so that the problem doesn't get optimized in the very first try.
```{r}
fn <- function(arg) {
  x <- arg[1]
  y <- arg[2]
  (x-1)^2 + (x-y-3)^4 + 0.0001*(y-4)^4 + 1
}
opt <- optimization(par = c(x=0, y=10), 
		    fn = fn, methods=c("SANN", "Nelder"), 
		    control=list(maxit=20))
opt <- run.optimization(opt)
opt <- run.optimization(opt)
run.optimization(opt)
```

## Example showing polyalgorithm not necessarily smart

```{r}
fn <- function(arg) {
  x <- arg[1]
  y <- arg[2]
  (x-1)^2 + (x-y-3)^4 + 0.0001*(y-4)^4 + 1
}
start <- c(x=0, y=10)
start
set.seed(12345) # REALLY IMPORTANT!
a1s <- optim(start, fn, method="SANN", control=list(maxit=20))
a1s
a1n <- optim(start, fn, method="Nelder-Mead", control=list(maxit=20))
a1n
a1sn <- optim(a1s$par, fn, method="Nelder-Mead", control=list(maxit=20))
a1sn
```



## Profiling example

Here's the same example, with a transform that fixes $y$ at the value 10.

```{r}
fixparms <- function(parms, fn, gr = NULL) {
  if (!inherits(fn, "objectiveFn"))
    fn <- simpleObjective(fn, gr)
  
  fn0 <- fn$fn0
  gr0 <- fn$gr0
  
  unfixed <- is.na(parms)
  
  forward <- function(par) {
    par[unfixed]
  }
  
  inverse <- function(par1) {
    result <- parms
    result[unfixed] <- par1
    result
  }
  
  fn1 <- function(par1, ...) fn0(inverse(par1), ...)
  if (is.null(gr0)) 
    gr1 <- NULL
  else
    gr1 <- function(par1, ...) gr0(inverse(par1), ...)[unfixed]
  
  structure(list(fn0 = fn0, gr0 = gr0, fn1 = fn1, gr1 = gr1, 
       forward = forward, inverse = inverse),
            class = "objectiveFn")
}

opt <- optimization(par = c(x = -2, y = 10), 
		    fn = fixparms(c(NA, 10), fn), 
		    methods=c("SANN", "Brent", "BFGS"), 
		    lower = list(Brent = -5), 
		    upper = list(Brent = 100),
		    control=list(maxit=20))
run.optimization(opt)
```

## Tracing example

This example traces all calls to `fn0`, `fn1` and the gradients:
```{r}
tracer <- function(fn, gr = NULL) {
  if (!inherits(fn, "objectiveFn"))
    fn <- simpleObjective(fn, gr)
  fn0 <- function(par, ...) {
    value <- fn$fn0(par, ...)
    cat("fn0(", paste(format(par), collapse=","), ") = ", 
        format(value), "\n", sep="")
    value
  }
  fn1 <- function(par1, ...) {
    value <- fn$fn1(par1, ...)
    cat("fn1(", paste(format(par1), collapse=","), ") = ", 
        format(value), "\n", sep="")
    value
  }
  if (is.null(fn$gr0))
    gr0 <- NULL
  else
    gr0 <- function(par, ...) {
      value <- fn$gr0(par, ...)
      cat("gr0(", paste(format(par), collapse=","), ") = (", 
        paste(format(value), collapse = ","), ")\n", sep="")
      value
    }
  if (is.null(fn$gr1))
    gr1 <- NULL
  else
    gr1 <- function(par, ...) {
      value <- fn$gr1(par, ...)
      cat("gr1(", paste(format(par), collapse=","), ") = (", 
        paste(format(value), collapse = ","), ")\n", sep="")
      value
    }
  structure(list(fn0 = fn0, gr0 = gr0, fn1 = fn1, gr1 = gr1, 
       forward = fn$forward, inverse = fn$inverse),
            class = "objectiveFn")
}

opt <- optimization(par = c(x = -2, y = 10), 
		    fn = tracer(fixparms(c(NA, 10), fn)), 
		    methods=c("SANN", "Brent", "BFGS"), 
		    lower = list(Brent = -5), 
		    upper = list(Brent = 10),
		    control=list(maxit=20))
#  JN: Brent is solving a different problem from SANN and BFGS
#  as shown by forcing upper bound to 10
run.optimization(opt)
```

JN: In the above, it took me a while to realize that the lower and upper bounds
only applied to x and only in the Brent problem. How would we specify bounds on parameters
3983 and 4587 in a 10000 parameter problem over spg, Rcgmin and Rtnmin where these parameters
have different ranges? What happens if par=c(NA, 10) and fixparms(c(NA,8))? Which fixed value
takes precedence. I'm being picky, but we want to make sure things are really clear. I actually
like the fixparms() layout. It may be awkward to code, but something like 
   fixparms(list(par[3214]=23, par[123]=.012)) could be easy to understand.

# Use cases  (JN)

It is helpful to think about how the tools will be used.

The existing `optimx()` function is designed to make it easy to run a suite of methods
on a single problem. `optimx` also runs checks on the bounds, the nature of the input
parameters, and the results of computing the gradient by the user's function as well
as a numerical approximation. After finishing, the KKT tests are computed, and a table of
results is available for display in several ways.

`optimx` also envisages running a single polyalgorithm by taking the result parameters
from the first listed method and starting the next method with these. It allows for 
the number of "iterations" in each method to be specified separately. An issue is that
"iterations", "functions" and "gradients" are not entirely parallel measures of effort, 
while methods vary by their particular controls.

A use-case that is not currently available is the comparison of several polyalgorithms.
For example, we may have two methods, labelled A and B. It would be useful to
be able to compare different orderings and different levels of effort within each method.
Using "iterations" as our measure of effort, we might want to run 10 A, then 100 B and
compare to 100 A, then 10 B, or 100 B then 10 A.

## Problem specification

The last use-case above raises the question of how to instruct R to run the polyalgorithms
and, especially, how to report and compare the results. It is not that it is particularly
difficult -- the run.optimization() lets us do each stage of a polyalgorithm.  What is 
awkward is providing a shorthand for a particular polyalgorithm so we can tabulate the
results easily, and then the tedium of gathering these results and displaying them. 


# What else?

* We should have more examples of transformations
* More optimization methods should be supported
* Need to handle the Hessian

# Attempt at a design

The following is intended to help drive the coding as at 2015-5-14.

## Top level functions

These are the functions that are likely called by the user, though some others
will be *export*ed.

*  ctrldefault())  
    - JN: I started to develop this, but after a couple of day's work/thinking, have decided
      that it makes more sense to limit the controls to reasonable common ones. If people 
      really want to work with the details, they will need to call the original packages and
      functions, or even dig into the code. For example, nlminb does not even properly define
      two of the controls. 
    - Called with no argument, sets overall / general defaults for things like trace, dowarn, etc.
    - Called with `method=methname`, where `methname` is a character string for a single method,
      sets default controls for that method. (This is NOT yet active!!!)
    - output is a list
    - JN: we might try `control=list(SANN:temp=34)` to set specific method controls. A small test using
      `pmatch()` and `names(control)` shows this to be feasible, but some care may be needed to make it
      work efficiently and in a way that can be easily maintained. I've found that getting controls 
      even a little wrong (and not checking them) can give bugs that are annoyingly difficult to track
      down. 
    - This mechanism lets us override general controls e.g., maxit, for particular methods, for example,
      in the "simple example" above, we might want `maxit=20` for Nelder-Mead and `maxit=1000` for SANN.
*  optchk()
    - verify bounds are admissible using bmchk()
    - check parameters are feasible (within bounds, or else moved to bounds) using bmchk()
    - check parameters have right type (directly in routine)
    - check initial fn is computable
    - check gradient function (if supplied) gives reasonable results
    - sets control defaults
    - checks parameter scaling
*  optimr()
   - Run a single method using a stats::optim() style of input and obtaining that structure output
   - Do we want to call interface routines? Possibly not, or we get too many.
*  opm()
   - a wrapper to call a set of methods or "ALL"
   - do we want to get rid of "control$all.methods" ? Having multiple ways to do something is an 
     invitation to trouble.
