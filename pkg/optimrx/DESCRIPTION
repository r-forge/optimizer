Description: Provides a replacement and extension of the optim()
    function to unify and streamline optimization capabilities in R
    and the R package universe 
    for smooth, possibly box constrained functions of several or
    many parameters. optimr is a refactoring of the optimx package
    to simplify maintenance and extension.
