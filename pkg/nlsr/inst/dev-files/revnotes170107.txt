Notes on review of nlsr package Jan 2017 by JN 

- added detailed output to dex() examples that show different classes of the returned objects.

- made clear where the .MissingVal usage is to be found in Rd file for nlsDeriv.

- in nlsr-devdoc.Rmd added silly joe(x) example to show possible trouble spot
